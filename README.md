# AM-Production-Planning-Instances
Instances of  AM Production Planning

Folder "3D models" includes 100 3D models with support structures in STL format.

Folder "Instances" constains 30 AMPP instances. Each file records the part ID of 3D models that are used. M2 files use machine 3 and 4. M4 files use all four machines.

Folder "part machine data" have data of 100 parts and 4 machines.

projection.txt records the coordinates of the 100 part projections derived from the 3D models. For polygon p1 with vertices (x11, y11), (x12, y12), (x13, y13) and hole vertices (x14, y14), (x15, y15), (x16, y16), coordinates are recorded as:

x11 x12 x13 NaN x14 x15 x16

y11 y12 y13 NaN y14 y15 y16
